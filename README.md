## SUMMARY

This Project contributes to the development of DC-DC converters for projects with a greater focus on the conversion of renewable energy. We decided to use and analyze the **SEPIC** converter in cars for advantages that this topology offers such as: the insulation between the panel and the storage system and the characteristic of handling lower, equal, or greater voltages than the panel, the latter allows the panel to be easily changed to work with the same battery, making it flexible to the inputs and outputs of the system. In this project we will make a laboratory prototype as the initial phase of a possible product that can be commercialized and, therefore, has the possibility of being the basis for the creation of a company or used in the electronic devices in cars.
